# Foursquare checkins to iCalendar

Foursquare's "Swarm" app still "works", and a few odd people
use it. Plus, you can still export your Foursquare checkins.

This is a Rust CLI that you can point at those checkins and
turn them into an `.ics` file that you can import into your
calendar.

Tested with Fantastical, YMMV with other iCalendar-supporting
applications!
